> [**This repo/contest is currently under construction so details may change before the start date.**]{.underline}

## Introduction[^readme-1]

[^readme-1]: Adapted from NHS 111 Website (<https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/iucadc-new-from-april-2021/111-online-statistics/>)

NHS 111 online (https://111.nhs.uk/) is a fast and convenient alternative to the 111 phone service for people who want to access 111 digitally.

Data from 111 online were first published as Management Information in July 2023. This means that the publication is not badged as Official Statistics but every effort is still made to adhere to the Code of Practice for Statistics.

## Forecasting Outputs

For this contest, we are looking to forecast monthly 111 online complete sessions at a range of geographical scales (i.e. England, Clinical Commisioning Regions, & ICBs) for the first 6 months of 2025 (January - June).

Forecasts and reports should be saved into the submission folder, matching the template found within.
