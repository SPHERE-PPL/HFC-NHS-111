# SPHERE-PPL Health Forecasting Contest - NHS 111 Online Usage

## Introduction[^readme-1]

[^readme-1]: Adapted from NHS 111 Website (<https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/iucadc-new-from-april-2021/111-online-statistics/>)
NHS 111 online (https://111.nhs.uk/) is a fast and convenient alternative to the 111 phone service for people who want to access 111 digitally.

Data from 111 online were first published as Management Information in July 2023. This means that the publication is not badged as Official Statistics but every effort is still made to adhere to the Code of Practice for Statistics.

## Forecasting Outputs

This contest has its own repository with pre-prepared data (found in the data folder) and a template report (report.qmd) which showcases how to load the data, perform analyses and then export results into the correct format. There is also be a folder for any additional scripts that are required.

For this contest, we are looking to forecast monthly 111 online complete sessions at a range of geographical scales (i.e. England, Clinical Commisioning Regions, & ICBs) for the first 6 months of 2025 (January - June).
